US Treasury yields are set to turn higher as ESZ4 show signs of basing. We have been of the view that the recent weakness in both Treasury yields and ESZ4 has been corrective and temporary. With equity markets now showing signs of capitulation  Friday saw the VXV VIX ratio close below 1 as both ESZ4 and 10s reaching proposed basing levels of 1190.501970.25 50d and 38.2 of Oct Dec rally and 2.0672.040 61.8 amp 23 rd of Oct Nov rise respectively we look expect a resumption of their larger uptrends.

We do not expect it to release a statement following the announcement as is usual protocol. Nevertheless there should be a small nugget of information for the gilt market in the announcement. In order to maintain the stock of QE at 375bn the Bank will need to reinvest 4.3bn following a January 22 redemption. Since this precedes the February MPC meeting we would expect reinvestment confirmation this week.   Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited. This report is intended for benjamin.petobaml.com.    Liquid Insight  06 January 2015 2  It has been an inauspicious start to the year for the GBP particularly versus the USD as UKUS rate differentials move against the sterling. The nearterm outlook thus appears to be challenging as inflation continues to disappoint and as investors look ahead to the UK general election. We think the decision to keep rates on hold for the majority of the Monetary Policy Committee should be a relatively easy one this time around and indeed over the coming months against the backdrop of a softening in nearterm inflationary pressures. The November CPI inflation reading fell from 1.3 to 1.0 significantly below consensus and to its lowest since Autumn 2002. In its November Inflation Report the BoE had looked for a 1.3 reading for November. In our view CPI inflation is set to fall further in the near term and will give the majority of the MPC greater control on the debate on the timing of the first rate hike. The December CPI due for release on 13 January is expected to show CPI inflation falling to around 0.7 yoy. This would trigger an open letter from BoE Governor Mark Carney to the Chancellor on the reasons why inflation is printed below 1 from the 2 target. Inflation is likely to trough around 0.5 early this year and this is notably below the BoE s expectations of a trough of around 1 in its November Inflation Report given the continued pressure on global energy prices. Clearly that gives the bulk of the MPC an easier backdrop to leave rates on hold. However the key debate for the MPC over the course of the year will be wage developments and it is this area where the two hawks  Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty fundamentally disagree with the rest of the MPC. The Chart of the Day illustrates this point clearly. The hawks assert that the average earnings growth is on the cusp of a meaningful rise over the coming year as suggested by developments in the KPMG survey on permanent staff salaries. This would suggest the need for an immediate rise in rates to counteract future inflationary pressures. By contrast the mainstream have to date preferred to wait for actual signs of a strong pickup in average earnings before deciding to act on rates. UK rates markets have gradually priced out the chance of a UK rate hike in 2015 with expectations currently for a move in 1Q16 versus our own expectation for a move in August 2015. The Minutes of December meeting reveal that the MPC has been surprised and is perhaps slightly uncomfortable by the extent to which UK rates markets have pushed back ratehike expectations. Indeed Governor Carney recently stated that the Bank of England is prepared to look through the current supplydriven fall in oil prices. The key to this view is whether UK inflation expectations will remain resilient to recent declines in oil prices Chart 1 and whether there are any second round effects  slowing average earnings for example. Since inflation expectations did not become dislodged to the upside despite UK CPI inflation averaging 3 over 200613 it would be asymmetric to expect it to become rapidly dislodged to the downside. Indeed while deflation is common within individual components of the UK CPI basket  in the decade prior to the crisis around 30 of items were typically in deflation  there is actually less downward pull on aggregate inflation than usual from such items at present.       Liquid Insight  06 January 2015 3 Chart 1 UK GfK BoE 12month inflation expectations  Source BoAML Global Research Bank of England  RPI measure of inflation Rates Something does not seem right The pace of gilt issuance will be slower in value terms over the balance of the fiscal year although it will step up a gear once the new fiscal year begins in March and the market is well aware of the upcoming 4.3bn BoE reinvestment. We suspect these have helped gilts do so well both in outright terms and relative to other markets but are concerned the market may be overplaying the story. The overall risk to be delivered over the quarter after allowing for the BoE s  risk extraction will still be fairly normal by recent standards because we will see a sizeable amount of linker risk coming via syndication later this month Chart 2 PVBP risk supply  net of BoE buybacks to end March  mn bp  Source BoAML Global Research Debt Management Office Bank of England And of course the higher pace of issuance expected from April will not be tempered by BoE reinvestment at least until September since redemptions will be bunched later in the 201516 fiscal year    2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 40 20 0 20 40 60 80 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 Nominal InflationLinked    Liquid Insight  06 January 2015 4 Chart 3 BoE QE holdings  bn showing late2015early2016 bunching  Source BoAML Global Research Debt Management Office Bank of England By pushing the expected first hike into 1Q16 we believe the market has also moved to expect the 31.6bn total of potential BoE reinvestments between September 2015 and January 2016 to go ahead whereas we would argue at least half that amount is still in the balance. The latest Bankstats numbers just out confirmed that banks purchased another large block of gilts in November taking the total over two months to 11bn. Although it possible this marks a desire to accumulate high quality liquid assets we would question the likely persistence of such a large monthly bid. Meanwhile overseas investors continued to leave the gilt market alone and sterling weakness seems to corroborate the idea that gilts are not benefiting from rebalancing out of negativelyyielding core Euro as some are suggesting Chart 4 Monthly net gilt buying by UK banks and overseas investors bn  Source BoAML Global Research Debt Management Office Bank of England We reaffirm our core bearish gilt view. The 5y5y Sonia at 1  is not our idea of a neutral policy rate. In trying to identify catalysts that might arrest the gilt rally perhaps we need look no further than this week s 10y nominal and 30y linker auctions. Though modest in size the yield levels are somewhat demanding. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 Jan13 Jul13 Jan14 Jul14 Jan15 Jul15 Jan16 Jul16 All past reinvestments 2015 amp 16 prospective reinvestments 20 15 10 5 0 5 10 15 20 10 11 12 13 14 Oseas Banks    Liquid Insight  06 January 2015 5 FX MPC losing the footrace versus the Fed It has been an inauspicious start to the year for GBP which has underperformed all of its G10 peers with the exception of the NOK. Sentiment has not been helped by further evidence of a loss of momentum in the UK economy with both the manufacturing and construction PMI numbers printing on the weaker side of expectations. Though the USD has made a strong start to 2015 GBP USD has been particularly hit hard driven primarily by a further shift in rate differentials in favor of the USD Chart 5. With the markets pushing back the chances of UK rate hikes into 1Q16 the Bank of England continues to lose the footrace to policy tightening versus the Fed. GBP USD is thus likely to remain under pressure in the nearterm as these forces continue to dominate sentiment. EUR GBP has once again failed to make a sustained break of the 0.7750 level despite significant pressure on the EUR at the start of the year. The conflicting forces of prospective QE weighing on EUR and softening nearterm UK inflationary pressures weighing on GBP suggest that EUR GBP will trade a range for the time being. But in our view with the UK general election on the horizon and continued uncertainty on the outcome there appears to be no respite for the GBP at present.
